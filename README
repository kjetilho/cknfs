This program checks for dead NFS servers.

I wrote it because I was tired of logging into a NFS client workstation,
only to find myself hung because one of my twenty-odd execution paths
pointed to some obscure NFS server that happened to be dead.

Well, this program fixes that problem.  It takes a list of execution
paths as arguments.   Each path is examined for an NFS mount point.
If found, the corresponding NFS server is checked.   Paths that lead
to dead NFS servers are ignored.  The remaining paths are printed to
stdout.  No more hung logins!

Typical examples:

	set path = `cknfs /bin /usr/bin /usr/ucb . /usr6/bin /sdg/bin`
	alias cd 'cknfs -e \!*; if ($status == 0) chdir \!*'

The latter example prevents you from hanging if you cd to a
directory that leads to a dead NFS server.
